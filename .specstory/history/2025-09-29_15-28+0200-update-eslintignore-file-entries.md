<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Modifying .eslintignore**

I need to modify the .eslintignore file by adding two paths. First, I should locate this file; it should typically be in the project root, even if it's not explicitly listed. It makes sense to read the file first using a simple file read function. Once I have the contents, I'll provide a status update before proceeding with the tool calls. Then, I can append the lines if they aren’t already present. I'll start by reading the .eslintignore file.</details></think>

I'll check the existing `.eslintignore` and add the two entries if they're not already present.

Could not find file '/Users/moi/Nextcloud/10.Scripts/bigmind/bigmind/.eslintignore' in the workspace.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Searching for ESLint config**

I need to modify the .eslintignore file, but it seems like it’s not found. That's puzzling! Maybe the ESLint configuration is located elsewhere, or possibly it's included in the package.json instead? It feels like a good idea to search for the presence of the .eslintignore file using a glob search. That should help me figure out where the configuration resides so I can make the necessary adjustments!</details></think>

---

Let me locate any existing ESLint ignore configuration in the repo to update it or create `.eslintignore` if missing.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Creating .eslintignore file**

I need to add entries to .eslintignore for two paths, but the file doesn't exist yet, so I’ll create it at the repo root. The user mentioned "scripts/render-icon-from-svg.js.r," which seems to be a typo. The actual file is "scripts/render-icon-from-svg.js."</details></think>
